    """
    Fetches the transaction receipt for a given transaction hash.

    This function retrieves the transaction receipt from the Ethereum network
    using the provided transaction hash. It utilizes caching to store results
    for a specified time-to-live (TTL) to improve performance and reduce
    network calls. The function is also decorated to automatically retry
    in case of failures and to debug if the coroutine gets stuck.

    Args:
        txhash: The transaction hash for which to retrieve the receipt.

    Returns:
        msgspec.Raw: The raw transaction receipt data.

    Examples:
        >>> txhash = "0x1234567890abcdef..."
        >>> receipt = await _get_transaction_receipt(txhash)
        >>> print(receipt)
